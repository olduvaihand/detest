Detest: A simple, header-only framework for C unit tests
========================================================

tl;dr
=====

1. Add '#include "detest.h"' to the top of your test file.
2. Optionally define setup and teardown routines that let you customize the test
   environment via the void* user_data member of detest_environment*s.
3. Define test functions with Detest_Assert* statements.
3. Build and run.

Test Suite Setup and Teardown
-----------------------------

You can define functions to perform test suite initialization and finalization.
These are particularly useful when doing expensive setup that can be used by
many or all tests.

#define Detest_TestSuiteSetupFn void test_suite_setup(detest_environment* env)
#define Detest_TestSuiteTeardownFn void test_suite_teardown(detest_environment* env)

A function defined by the Detest_TestSuiteSetupFn macro will be called once
before any tests are run.  It is passed a detest_environment* called env that
can be customized via a void* member named user_data.

A function defined by the Detest_TestSuiteTeardownFn macro will be called once
after all tests are run.  It is passed a detest_environment* called env that
can be customized via a void* member named user_data.  Typically you would
deallocate resources allocated by the Detest_TestSuiteSetupFn.

Test Setup and Teardown
-----------------------

You can define functions to perform test initialization and finalization.
These are particularly useful when doing setup that ensures identical initial
state for all tests.

#define Detest_TestSetupFn void test_setup(detest_environment* env)
#define Detest_TestTeardownFn void test_teardown(detest_environment* env)

A function defined by the Detest_TestSetupFn macro will be called once
before each test is run.  It is passed a detest_environment* called env
that can be customized via a void* member named user_data.  If you're using a
test suite setup function, 

A function defined by the Detest_TestTeardownFn macro will be called once
after each test is run.  It is passed a detest_environment* called env that
can be customized via a void* member named user_data.  Typically you would
reset state or deallocate resources allocated by the Detest_TestSetupFn.

Tests
-----

Each test is defined by the Detest_TestFn macro.

#define Detest_TestFn(name) void name##_fn(detest_test* test, detest_environment* env)

Use the detest_environment* env to access custom state via the user_data member.

A test looks like normal code to set up the condition(s) to test followed by one
or more assertions.  Assertions are defined in detest.h as macros.  There are
currently a small number of assertions for checking the truth of an expression;
numeric, string, and pointer equality; and membership in numeric ranges.

Under the hood, detest uses setjmp/longjmp to bail on a failing test, record it,
and resume the suite.

Defining the Test Suite
-----------------------
Once your setup, teardown, and test functions are written, you define the test
suite at the bottom of the test with one of the Detest_TestSuite* macros:

1 Detest_TestSuite(...)
2 Detest_TestSuite_WithSuiteSetupAndTeardown(...)
3 Detest_TestSuite_WithTestSetupAndTeardown(...)
4 Detest_TestSuite_WithSuiteAndTestSetupAndTeardown(...)
5 Detest_TestSuite_WithSuiteAndTestSetupAndTeardownCustom(
    suite_setup_fn, suite_teardown_fn, test_setup_fn, test_teardown_fn, ...)

Detest_TestSuite macros 1-4 assume you've written your entire test suite with
the Detest_FooFn macros and rely on conventional names to simplify the test
definition.  Each macro accepts a comma separated list of Detest_Test(test_fn)s
and produces a test suite data structure and a main function that will execute
the test suite.

The custom macro allows you to specify the remaining combinations of setup and
teardown functions.  The Detest_Noop macro should be used for setup and teardown
functions that aren't defined.  The variadic arguments should each be
Detest_Test(test_fn)s as with the standard Detest_TestSuite macros.

Running Tests and Interpreting Output
-------------------------------------

Build tests using your tool of choice with the detest.h header's parent
directory on the include path and run the resulting executables.

As tests are run, a '.' or an 'F' will print to stdout indicating a test passing
or failing, respectively.  After all tests are run, the names of all passing
tests will be printed followed by the names and error messages from all failing
tests.
